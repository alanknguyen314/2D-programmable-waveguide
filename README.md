# Source code for: Scaling on-chip photonic neural processors using arbitrarily programmable wave propagation

## Overview
We propose and demonstrate a device, a *2D-programmable waveguide* whose refractive index as a function of space, $n(x,z)$, can be rapidly reprogrammed, allowing arbitrary control over the wave propagation in the device [1]. We trained the device with a hybrid in-situ, in-silico backpropagation algorithm [2] to perform neural network inference. In particular, we achieved 96\% accuracy on vowel classification and 86\% accuracy on $7 \times 7$-pixel MNIST handwritten-digit classification, with no trained digital-electronic pre- or post-processing.

In this repository, we provide the source code used to generate the results in our paper, written in Python and utilizing the PyTorch library for machine learning tasks. Designed for execution in a Jupyter notebook environment, this repository includes source code for simulations and experiments. Primarily intended for internal use, the code lacks detailed documentation, and the experimental portion presupposes connectivity to specific experimental devices, such as spatial-light modulators and cameras. The simulation code is self-contained and should run on system. The repository's primary contents are the source code alongside several usage examples. Data and code used to generate the figures of the paper will shortly be made accessible in the Zenodo repository [3]. For users interested in using this code or with inquiries, please feel free to contact us via the email addresses listed in the paper.
